# Minecraft Server: Bedrock Edition Project

**Project Overview:**
---------------------
In this project, I decided to create and configure a Minecraft Server: Bedrock Edition. I wanted this to provide a safe place for my kids, friends, and family to play the game. While Minecraft Bedrock offers Realms to host your own Minecraft world for Multiplayer, it does have its drawbacks. It has a maximum of 11 players that can play at once, less control over player control, and a $7.99 monthly fee.  

**Prerequisites**
-----------------
1. A mini PC with a Quad-core processor, 4GB of RAM, a 10 GB SSD, and a NIC capable of at least 5 
Mbps.
2. A Server Operating System
3. A Hypervisor
4. Minecraft Server files
5. A USB drive
6. A Mojang account and license to play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
