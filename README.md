# Minecraft Server: Bedrock Edition Project

**Project Overview:**

In this project I decided to create and configure a Mincecraft Server: Bedrock Edition. I wanted this to provide a safe place for my kids and their friends and family to play the game. While Minecraft Bedrock offers Realms to host your own Minecraft world for Multiplayer, it does have its drawbacks. It has a maximum of 11 players that can play at once, less control over player control, and a $7.99 a month fee.
